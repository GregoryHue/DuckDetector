## Project setup

*This part is not finished yet as I keep switching between Windows Native and WSL2. Windows Native is poor in terms of commands and WSL2 is complicated to set up. Thinking about setting Dual Boot with Ubuntu. And I keep getting momery leak problems, wrong librairies versions, etc ...*

## Versions

* Python 3.8.10
* Ubuntu 20.04.5
